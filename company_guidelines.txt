Their stated mission: to go beyond just supporting business IT — to transform the way businesses operate by delivering “smart, strategic technologies that drive innovation, boost efficiency and fuel long-term success”. 


They emphasise helping organisations perform more efficiently, productively and competitively — aligning cost-efficient services with the latest IT/technology solutions. 


Acordis positions itself as a partner rather than just a vendor: they emphasise long-term relationships, consulting/advisory services, and full lifecycle involvement (design → deployment → training). 

They serve a wide range of industries (non-profit, sports organisations, education, financial institutions) and emphasise scalability (from growing businesses to enterprise). 


They highlight strong credentials: many technology partnerships (Cisco, HP, Microsoft, Palo Alto, etc) and certifications/accreditations to support their claim of being a “premier IT solutions provider”. 

They have a clear community/outreach stance: emphasise giving back, supporting youth/education, engagement in local community in South Florida. 


On governance & culture: they publish an Equity, Diversity & Inclusion policy stating a commitment to inclusive environment, non-discrimination, equal opportunities. 


On privacy & data handling: they publish a Privacy Policy emphasising control of personally identifiable info, etc. 


Their goals appear to include: increasing business productivity for clients, reducing operational/IT costs, improving communication & security, enabling business growth through technology. (E.g., from their Managed IT Services proposition: “simplify IT management, strengthen cybersecurity, focus on growth – not downtime”.)
